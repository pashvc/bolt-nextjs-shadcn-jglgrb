## Architecture Decisions

### Authentication
- Using client-side mock authentication initially
- Storing auth state in React Context
- JWT token simulation for protected routes

### State Management
- React Context for global state (auth, theme, language)
- Local state with useState for component-level state
- Custom hooks for reusable logic

### Component Structure
- Atomic design principles
- Shared components in `components/ui`
- Feature-specific components in `components/features`
- Layout components in `components/layout`

### Data Flow
- Mock services in `services` directory
- Type definitions in `types` directory
- Utility functions in `utils` directory

## Best Practices
1. Component file naming: PascalCase
2. Utility file naming: camelCase
3. One component per file
4. Consistent import ordering
5. Props interface definitions
6. Error boundary implementation
7. Loading state handling
8. Responsive design first
9. Accessibility considerations

## Known Issues
- None currently

## Performance Considerations
1. Image optimization
2. Code splitting
3. Dynamic imports
4. Memoization where necessary
5. Bundle size monitoring

## Security Measures
1. Input sanitization
2. XSS prevention
3. CSRF protection
4. Secure authentication flow
5. Protected routes implementation
